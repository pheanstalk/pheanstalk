        <introduction>
            <p>
                If you are new to unit testing it is recommended that you
                actually try the code out as we go.
                There is actually not very much to type and you will get
                a feel for the rhythm of test first programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run the examples as is, you need an empty directory with the folders
                <em>classes</em>, <em>tests</em> and <em>temp</em>.
                Unpack the <a href="simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a> framework
                into the <em>tests</em> folder and make sure your web server
                can reach these locations.
            </p>

            <p>
                The quick <a local="{{simple_test}}">introductory example</a>
                featured the unit testing of a simple log class.
                In this tutorial on SimpleTest I am going to try to
                tell the whole story of developing this class.
                This PHP class is small and simple and in the course of
                this introduction will receive far more attention than
                it probably would in production.
                Yet even this tiny class contains some surprisingly difficult
                design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe they are too difficult?
                Rather than trying to design the whole thing up front
                I&apos;ll start with a known requirement, namely
                we want to write messages to a file.
                These messages must be appended to the file if it exists.
                Later we will want priorities and filters and things, but
                for now we will place the file writing requirement in
                the forefront of our thoughts.
                We will think of nothing else for fear of getting confused.
                OK, let&apos;s make a test...
<php><![CDATA[
<strong><?php
if (! defined('SIMPLE_TEST')) {
    define('SIMPLE_TEST', 'simpletest/');
}
require_once(SIMPLE_TEST . 'autorun.php');

class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    function testCreatingNewFile() {
    }
}
?></strong>
]]></php>
                Piece by piece here is what it all means.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>SIMPLE_TEST</code> constant
                is the path from this file to the Simple Test classes.
                The classes could be placed into the path in the
                <em>php.ini</em> file, but if you are using a shared
                hosting account you do not have access to this.
                To keep everybody happy this path is declared explicitely
                in the test script.
                Later we will see how it eventually ends up in only one
                place.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is this <em>autorun.php</em> file?
                The Simple Test libraries are a toolkit for creating
                your own standardised test suite.
                They can be used &quot;as is&quot; without trouble, but consist
                of separate components that have to be assembled.
                <em>autorun.php</em> is a special component : it provides both
                the unit testing and display pieces. It catches all test classes
                and runs them automagically.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is probable that you will eventually write your own display
                and so including the default set is optional.
                SimpleTest includes a usable, but basic, test display class
                called <code>HtmlReporter</code>.
                It can record test starts, ends, errors, passes and fails.
                It displays this information as quickly as possible in case
                the test code crashes the script and obscures the point of
                failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The tests themselves are gathered in test case classes.
                This one is typical in extending
                <code>UnitTestCase</code>.
                When the test is run it will search for any method within
                that starts with the name &quot;test&quot; and run it.
                Our only test method at present is called
                <code>testCreatingNewFile()</code>.
                There is nothing in it yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now the empty method definition on its own does not do anything.
                We need to actually place some code inside it.
                The <code>UnitTestCase</code> class
                will typically generate test events when run and these events are
                sent to an observer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now to add test code...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php
if (! defined('SIMPLE_TEST')) {
    define('SIMPLE_TEST', 'simpletest/');
}
require_once(SIMPLE_TEST . 'autorun.php');<strong>
require_once('../classes/log.php');</strong>

class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    function testCreatingNewFile() {<strong>
        @unlink('../temp/test.log');
        $log = new Log('../temp/test.log');
        $log->message('Should write this to a file');
        $this->assertTrue(file_exists('../temp/test.log'));</strong>
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
            </p>
            <p>
                You are probably thinking that that is a lot of test code for
                just one test and I would agree.
                Don&apos;t worry.
                This is a fixed cost and from now on we can add tests
                pretty much as one liners.
                Even less when using some of the test artifacts that we
                will use later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now comes the first of our decisions.
                Our test file is called <em>log_test.php</em> (any name
                is fine) and is in a folder called <em>tests</em> (anywhere is fine).
                We have called our code file <em>log.php</em> and this is
                the code we are going to test.
                I have placed it into a folder called <em>classes</em>, so that means
                we are building a class, yes?
            </p>
            <p>
                For this example I am, but the unit tester is not restricted
                to testing classes.
                It is just that object oriented code is easier to break
                down and redesign for testing.
                It is no accident that the fine grain testing style of unit
                tests has arisen from the object community.
            </p>
            <p>
                The test itself is minimal.
                It first deletes any previous test file that may have
                been left lying around.
                Design decisions now come in thick and fast.
                Our class is called <code>Log</code>
                and takes the file path in the constructor.
                We create a log and immediately send a message to
                it using a method named
                <code>message()</code>.
                Sadly, original naming is not a desirable characteristic
                of a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The smallest unit of a...er...unit test is the assertion.
                Here we want to assert that the log file we just sent
                a message to was indeed created.
                <code>UnitTestCase::assertTrue()</code>
                will send a pass event if the condition evaluates to
                true and a fail event otherwise.
                We can have a variety of different assertions and even more
                if we extend our base test cases.
                Here is the base list...
                <table><tbody>
                    <tr><td><code>assertTrue($x)</code></td><td>Fail if $x is false</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertFalse($x)</code></td><td>Fail if $x is true</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertNull($x)</code></td><td>Fail if $x is set</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertNotNull($x)</code></td><td>Fail if $x not set</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertIsA($x, $t)</code></td><td>Fail if $x is not the class or type $t</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertEqual($x, $y)</code></td><td>Fail if $x == $y is false</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertNotEqual($x, $y)</code></td><td>Fail if $x == $y is true</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertIdentical($x, $y)</code></td><td>Fail if $x === $y is false</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertNotIdentical($x, $y)</code></td><td>Fail if $x === $y is true</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertReference($x, $y)</code></td><td>Fail unless $x and $y are the same variable</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertCopy($x, $y)</code></td><td>Fail if $x and $y are the same variable</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertWantedPattern($p, $x)</code></td><td>Fail unless the regex $p matches $x</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertNoUnwantedPattern($p, $x)</code></td><td>Fail if the regex $p matches $x</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertNoErrors()</code></td><td>Fail if any PHP error occoured</td></tr>
                    <tr><td><code>assertError($x)</code></td><td>Fail if no PHP error or incorrect message</td></tr>
                </tbody></table>
            </p>
            <p>
                We are now ready to execute our test script by pointing the
                browser at it.
                What happens?
                It should crash...
                <div class="demo">
                    <b>Fatal error</b>:  Failed opening required '../classes/log.php' (include_path='') in <b>/home/marcus/projects/lastcraft/tutorial_tests/Log/tests/log_test.php</b> on line <b>7</b>
                </div>
                The reason is that we have not yet created <em>log.php</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hang on, that&apos;s silly!
                You aren&apos;t going to build a test without creating any of the
                code you are testing, surely...?
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="tdd" title="Test Driven Development">
            <p>
                Co-inventor of
                <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a>,
                Kent Beck, has come up with another manifesto.
                The book is called
                <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321146530/ref=lib_dp_TFCV/102-2696523-7458519?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;vi=reader#reader-link">Test driven development</a>
                or TDD and raises unit testing to a senior position in design.
                In a nutshell you write a small test first and
                then only get this passing by writing code.
                Any code.
                Just get it working.
            </p>
            <p>
                You write another test and get that passing.
                What you will now have is some duplication and generally lousy
                code.
                You re-arrange
                (refactor)
                that code while the tests are passing and thus while you cannot break
                anything.
                Once the code is as clean as possible you are ready to add more
                functionality.
                In turn you only achieve this by adding another test and starting the
                cycle again.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a radical approach and one that I feel is incomplete.
                However it makes for a great way to explain a unit tester!
                We happen to have a failing, not to say crashing, test right now so
                let&apos;s write some code into <em>log.php</em>...
<php><![CDATA[
<strong><?php
class Log {
    
    function Log($file_path) {
    }
        
    function message($message) {
    }
}
?></strong>
]]></php>
                This is the minimum to avoid a PHP fatal error.
                We now get the response...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>testoflogging</h1>
                    <span class="fail">Fail</span>: testcreatingnewfile-&gt;True assertion failed.<br />
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: red; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
                    <strong>0</strong> passes and <strong>1</strong> fails.</div>
                </div>
                And &quot;testoflogging&quot; has failed.
                PHP has this really annoying effect of reducing class and method
                names to lower case internally.
                SimpleTest uses these names by default to describe the tests, but
                we can replace them with our own...
<php><![CDATA[
class TestOfLogging extends UnitTestCase {
    <strong>function TestOfLogging() {
        $this->UnitTestCase('Log class test');
    }</strong>
    function testCreatingNewFile() {
        @unlink('../temp/test.log');
        $log = new Log('../temp/test.log');
        $log->message('Should write this to a file');<strong>
        $this->assertTrue(file_exists('../temp/test.log'), 'File created');</strong>
    }
}
]]></php>
                Giving...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>Log class test</h1>
                    <span class="fail">Fail</span>: testcreatingnewfile-&gt;File created.<br />
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: red; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
                    <strong>0</strong> passes and <strong>1</strong> fails.</div>
                </div>
                There is not much we can do about the method name I am afraid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Test messages like this are a bit like code comments.
                Some organisations insist on them while others ban them as clutter
                and a waste of good typing.
                I am somewhere in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get the test passing we could just create the file in the
                <code>Log</code> constructor.
                This &quot;faking it&quot; technique is very useful for checking
                that your tests work when the going gets tough.
                This is especially so if you have had a run of test failures
                and just want to confirm that you haven&apos;t just missed something
                stupid.
                We are not going that slow, so...
<php><![CDATA[
<?php   
class Log {<strong>
    var $_file_path;</strong>
        
    function Log($file_path) {<strong>
        $this->_file_path = $file_path;</strong>
    }
        
    function message($message) {<strong>
        $file = fopen($this->_file_path, 'a');
        fwrite($file, $message . "\n");
        fclose($file);</strong>
    }
}
?>
]]></php>
                It took me no less than four failures to get to the next step.
                I had not created the temporary directory, I had not made it
                publicly writeable, I had one typo and I did not check in the
                new directory to CVS.
                Any one of these could have kept me busy for several hours if
                they had come to light later, but then that is what testing is for.
                With the necessary fixes we get...
                <div class="demo">
                    <h1>Log class test</h1>
                    <div style="padding: 8px; margin-top: 1em; background-color: green; color: white;">1/1 test cases complete.
                    <strong>1</strong> passes and <strong>0</strong> fails.</div>
                </div>
                Success!
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not like the rather minimal style of the display.
                Passes are not shown by default because generally you do
                not need more information when you actually understand what is
                going on.
                If you do not know what is going on then you should write another test.
            </p>
            <p>
                OK, this is a little strict.
                If you want to see the passes as well then you
                <a local="display_subclass_tutorial">can subclass the
                <code>HtmlReporter</code> class</a>
                and attach that to the test instead.
                Even I like the comfort factor sometimes.

            <p>
                There is a subtlety here.
                We don&apos;t want the file created until we actually send
                a message.
                Rather than think about this too deeply we will just add
                another test for it...

                Actually I knew it would.
                I am putting this test in to confirm this partly for peace of mind, but
                also to document the behaviour.
                That little extra test line says more in this context than
                a dozen lines of use case or a whole UML activity diagram.
                That the test suite acts as a source of documentation is a pleasant
                side effect of all these tests.

                Should we clean up the temporary file at the end of the test?
                I usually do this once I am finished with a test method
                and it is working.
                I don&apos;t want to check in code that leaves remnants of
                test files lying around after a test.
                I don&apos;t do it while I am writing the code, though.
                I probably should, but sometimes I need to see what is
                going on and there is that comfort thing again.

                In a real life project we usually have more than one test case,
                so we next have to look at
